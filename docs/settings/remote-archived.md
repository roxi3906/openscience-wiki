# Remote control and Archived

## Remote control

Remote control lets a browser connect to the running Open Science application. A short-lived token or pairing step and the local process protect the entry point; this feature does not publish the entire data directory as a public website.

Main areas and controls:

- Local/Browser access status: Start, Stop, or Refresh appears according to the current state.
- `Browser link is ready`: `Copy` copies the access URL and `Open` opens it in a browser. The `Scan to open` QR code connects another device.
- Access steps: keep the desktop application running, confirm that the network or service is reachable, and complete pairing on a new device.
- Remote.It: detects a desktop CLI that the user installed separately and offers Setup, Retry, or Disconnect. Open Science neither bundles it nor registers a third-party account.
- `Trusted browsers`: shows browser, platform, and Last used. `Revoke <browser>` invalidates its next request or WebSocket reconnection.
- `Pairing requests (n)`: verify the browser, platform, address, and six-digit code, then choose `Reject`, `Allow once`, or `Always trust this browser`.

Do not share an access URL containing a token in a public channel. Permanently trust only devices you control. If a device is lost, revoke it immediately and stop or recreate the remote entry point.

## Archived

Archived separates Projects from individually archived Sessions. A project row shows the archive time and `Manage`; its detail view lists the project's Sessions.

| Control | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Project row/`Manage` | Open the archived project details |
| `Restore project` | Restore the project and make its project-hidden sessions visible again |
| `Delete project` | Permanently delete the project and related session records after confirmation |
| Session `Restore` | Restore an individually archived session; disabled until its archived project is restored |
| Session `Delete` | Permanently delete the session after confirmation |

Archiving organizes records; deletion cannot be undone. The deletion dialog shows the target name or session count. Download needed artifacts and Notebooks before confirming.
